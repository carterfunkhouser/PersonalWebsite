abstract: Posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) are associated with significant distress
  and impairment. Research has therefore focused on identifying neurobehavioral deficits
  that contribute to the pathophysiology of PTSS. One issue that has contributed to
  difficulty in identifying these deficits is the highly heterogeneous nature of PTSS.
  PTSS is comprised of four, factor analytically distinct dimensions of symptoms -
  re-experiencing, avoidance, hyperarousal, and negative cognitions and mood. It is
  therefore unlikely that there is one single mechanism that accounts for all of PTSS
  and elucidating neurobehavioral deficits associated with specific PTSS symptom dimensions
  may better inform clinical prevention and intervention efforts. Within the broader
  internalizing disorder literature, two key constructs that contribute to psychopathology
  are aberrant neural reactivity to threat and reward. However, the literature linking
  PTSS to these deficits is mixed, suggesting that aberrant neural reactivity to threat
  or reward may be specific to certain PTSS dimensions. In a sample of 51 trauma-exposed
  adults with a range PTSS, the present study therefore examined how the four dimensions
  of PTSS uniquely relate to two well-validated event-related potential (ERP) neural
  indices of threat and reward reactivity - the error-related negativity (ERN) and
  reward-related positivity (RewP), respectively. Results indicated that hyperarousal
  symptoms were associated with enhanced ERN, and enhanced RewP. In contrast, negative
  cognitions and mood symptoms were uniquely associated with a more blunted RewP.
  These results indicate that certain PTSS symptom dimensions have unique relations
  with neural indicators of threat and reward reactivity and may therefore have distinct
  pathophysiologies.
