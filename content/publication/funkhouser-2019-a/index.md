abstract: Non-suicidal self-injury is a risk factor for suicidal behavior, particularly
  in females. Two prominent theories of suicide suggest that habituation to the psychophysiological
  aversiveness of NSSI is a mechanism by which NSSI exposure may lead to increased
  risk for suicide. Several laboratory studies examining the relationship between
  physiological habituation and suicide attempt history have yielded mixed results,
  potentially due to their use of broad measures of physiological arousal and/or focus
  on specific psychopathologies. However, no studies have examined the association
  between the time course (e.g., habituation, initial reactivity) of responding to
  aversiveness and NSSI, which may help to elucidate psychophysiological mechanisms
  of NSSI. Therefore, we examined habituation and initial reactivity to aversiveness
  (indexed by the time course of acoustic startle reflex, a well-validated measure
  of defensive responding) in three groups of young adult females â€“ those with a history
  of NSSI, psychiatric controls matched on potential confounds (e.g., psychopathology,
  trauma history, demographics), and healthy controls. Results indicated that individuals
  with a history of NSSI exhibited blunted initial reactivity and marginally slower
  habituation to aversiveness relative to the two control groups. The NSSI group's
  insensitivity to aversiveness may reflect prior psychophysiological habituation,
  and may be a mechanism through which prior NSSI exposure leads to increased risk
  for suicidal behavior.
