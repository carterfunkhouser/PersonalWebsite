abstract: Heightened responsivity to unpredictable, and perhaps predictable, threat
  characterizes some internalizing disorders and may be vulnerability factors for
  psychopathology as well. However, few studies have directly tested whether individual
  differences in unpredictable and/or predictable threat responding longitudinally
  predict symptoms of psychopathology and functional outcomes. Examining functioning
  is particularly important given that functioning is separable from symptoms of psychopathology.
  The present study examined whether electromyography startle measures of predictable
  and/or unpredictable threat responding was associated with interviewer-assessed
  symptoms of internalizing psychopathology and functional impairment at baseline
  (n = 409) and one-year follow-up (n = 104). Elevated startle responding to unpredictable
  and predictable threat longitudinally predicted a worsening of functioning over
  time and this effect was independent of change of symptoms over time. Importantly,
  threat responding at baseline predicted functional impairment during the follow-up
  independent of the effects of DSM-defined fear-based (e.g., panic disorder) or distress-misery
  (e.g., major depressive disorder) internalizing disorders. These findings provide
  initial support for the incremental validity of neurobiological vulnerability markers
  of threat responding over and above DSM disorders and highlight the importance of
  distinguishing functional outcomes from symptom outcomes.
