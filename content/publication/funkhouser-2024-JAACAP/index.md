abstract: 'Novel strategies that improve the effectiveness of preventive interventions for adolescents at risk for suicide are needed. This pragmatic randomized controlled trial will examine whether a promising candidate — comprehensive, digitally enhanced delivery of an evidence-based intervention for high-risk youth — can be implemented in a real-world clinical setting and can improve the management of suicidal thoughts, behaviors, and risk factors.'
