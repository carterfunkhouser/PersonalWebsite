abstract: Emotion-modulated startle is a frequently used method
  in affective science. Although there is a growing literature on the reliability
  of this measure, it is presently unclear how many startle responses are necessary
  to obtain a reliable signal. The present study therefore evaluated the reliability
  of startle responding as a function of number of startle responses (NoS) during
  a widely used threat-of-shock paradigm, the NPU-threat task, in a clinical (N =
  205) and non-clinical (N = 92) sample. In the clinical sample, internal consistency
  was also examined independently for healthy controls vs. those with panic disorder
  and/or major depression and retest reliability was assessed as a function of NoS.
  Although results varied somewhat by diagnosis and for retest reliability, the overall
  pattern of results suggested that six startle responses per condition were necessary
  to obtain acceptable reliability in clinical and non-clinical samples during this
  threat-of-shock paradigm in the present study.
