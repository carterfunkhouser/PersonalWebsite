abstract: 'Introduction: Disruptions in neural measures of reward responsiveness are
  implicated in risk for and the development of Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) in
  general, but it is not clear if this is also true for Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD).
  To date, no studies have examined neural reward responsiveness in cannabis users
  using EEG. Methods: Cannabis users (CU; n = 67) and non-users (n = 60) were drawn
  from larger studies of individuals with and without internalizing and externalizing
  psychopathology. Groups were matched on current and lifetime psychopathology. Participants
  completed a validated monetary reward task during electroencephalogram (EEG). One-way
  between subject analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models examined group differences
  in four EEG indicators of reward responsiveness - the reward positivity (RewP) and
  feedback negativity (FN) event-related potentials and two time–frequency measures
  (reward-related delta and loss-related theta). Results: CU demonstrated an enhanced
  RewP to the attainment of monetary reward compared to non-users (p = .004), even
  after controlling for relevant covariates. Secondary analyses found that occasional
  CU, but not current CUD or remitted CUD, showed enhanced RewP compared to non-users.
  There were no significant differences in FN, reward-related delta, or loss-related
  theta time–frequency measures between groups. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this
  is the first study to show preliminary evidence that CU have an enhanced RewP to
  reward and the extent of disruption may be related to CUD status. Our findings suggest
  that greater neural reward responsiveness may only be seen among occasional CU,
  not necessarily among CU with current or remitted CUD.'
