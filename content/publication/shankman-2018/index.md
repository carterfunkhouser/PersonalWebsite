abstract: This study examined whether the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID),
  a widely used semistructured interview designed to assess psychopathology categorically,
  can be adapted to identify reliable and valid severity dimensions of psychopathology.
  The present study also examined whether these severity dimensions have better psychometric
  properties (internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and concurrent and predictive
  validity) than categorical diagnoses. Participants (N = 234) were recruited from
  the community and clinics. Retest reliability and prospective predictive validity
  (symptoms and functioning 1 year later) were examined in subsamples of participants.
  Dimensional severity scales were created from an adapted version of the SCID for
  both current and lifetime major depression, alcohol, substance, post-traumatic stress
  disorder, panic, agoraphobia, social anxiety, specific phobia, obsessive-compulsive
  disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. The SCID's severity scales demonstrated
  substantial internal consistency (all Cronbach's $α$s textgreater.80), test-retest
  reliability, and concurrent and predictive validity. Symptom severity scales demonstrated
  significant incremental validity over and above categorical diagnoses for both current
  and prospective outcomes. The psychometric properties of SCID-identified symptom
  scales were far superior to the psychometrics of categorical diagnoses for both
  current and lifetime psychopathology. These results highlight the feasibility and
  utility of the SCID to assess reliable and valid symptom severity dimensions of
  both current and lifetime psychopathology.
