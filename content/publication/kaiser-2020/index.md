abstract: Psychopathology research has increasingly sought to study the etiology and
  treatment of individual symptoms, rather than categorical diagnoses. However, it
  is unclear whether commonly used measures have adequate psychometric properties
  for assessing individual symptoms. This study examined the test-retest reliability
  and familial concordance (an indicator of validity) of the symptoms of Major Depressive
  Disorder (MDD), a disorder consisting of nine core symptoms, most of which are aggregated
  (e.g., symptom 7 of the DSM criteria for MDD is worthlessness or guilt). Lifetime
  MDD symptoms were measured in 504 young adults (237 sibling pairs) using the Structured
  Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID). Fifty-one people completed a second SCID within
  three weeks of their first SCID. Results indicated that aggregated and unaggregated
  symptoms demonstrated moderate to substantial test-retest reliability and generally
  significant, but slight to fair familial concordance (with the highest familial
  concordance being for markedly diminished interest or pleasure and its unaggregated
  components â€“ decreased interest and decreased pleasure). Given the increasing focus
  on the differential validity of individual MDD symptoms, the present study suggests
  that interview-based assessments of depression can assess most individual symptoms
  with adequate levels of reliability and validity.
